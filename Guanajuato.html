The Mummies of Guanajuato are a number of naturally mummified bodies interred during a cholera outbreak around Guanajuato,<b>
Mexico in 1833.<b>
The human bodies appear to have been disinterred between 1870 and 1958. During that time, a local tax was in place requiring <b>
a fee to be paid for "perpetual" burial. Some bodies for which the tax was not paid were disinterred, and some—apparently those<b>
 in the best condition—were stored in a nearby building.<b>
