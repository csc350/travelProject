<h1>Palacio Canton </h1>
<p>
Palacio Canton is a magnificent building that is home to one of the best Regional Museums about the Yucatan and Mayan culture.<b>
It plays double duty to architectural and cultural history. National Institute of Anthropology and History purchased this building<b>
that was originally designed for General Francisco Canton in the early 1900 as his residence. The original architecture is untouched<b>
and the contents of the museum just as appealing.<b>
