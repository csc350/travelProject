<p style="font-size:160%;" style="font-family:verdana;">Why us?</p>
<p>
Planning a holiday can be both a difficult and expensive task.  
By offering a means to plan a holiday is nothing new, we believe that by applying a social-network-like element and allowing users to meet other holiday-goes on their travels, we can offer something new and unique whilst also demonstrating an understanding of database technology.
Holidays can prove to be extremely expensive, and most people only get a few days each year.  Therefore, it is important to ensure that we are doing all we can to maximize the way we are using that time and money
LIFETRAVEL seeks to help holiday-goers make the best possible use of their time.
We strive to make your experience easy as possible and provide you with the fast information for you to plan your trip around the world accordingly.
