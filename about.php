    <p>Why us?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="body">
    <p>Planning a holiday can be both a difficult and expensive task.<br/>
	   By offering a means to plan a holiday is nothing new, we believe 
	   that by applying a social-network-like element <br/> and allowing users 
	   to meet other holiday-goes on their travels, we can offer something 
	   new and unique whilst also demonstrating an understanding of database 
	   technology.<br/>Holidays can prove to be extremely expensive, and most people 
	   only get a few days each year.<br/>  Therefore, it is important to ensure that 
	   we are doing all we can to maximize the way we are using that time and money
	   LIFETRAVEL seeks to help holiday-goers make the best possible use of their time.<br/>
	   We strive to make your experience easy as possible and provide you with the fast 
	   information for you to plan your trip around the world accordingly.<br/>
